# Solidity-Assembly-Yul
Using advanced Solidity, writing Smart contracts in Yul

Yul (previously also called JULIA or IULIA) is an intermediate language that can be compiled to bytecode for different backends.



Programs written in Yul should be readable, even if the code is generated by a compiler from Solidity or another high-level language.

Control flow should be easy to understand to help in manual inspection, formal verification and optimization.

The translation from Yul to bytecode should be as straightforward as possible.

Yul should be suitable for whole-program optimization.
